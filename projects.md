  <h2 id="generalization">Improving lab-to-field generalization of activity recognition models</h2>
  <p>(Postdoc) Activity recognition models show high performance when trained and tested with data collected in controlled environments like experiments. However, when used in real-life, the performance of these models tends to drop significantly. We study two causes for this: new user scenario and usage of different devices. We propose solutions based on feature learning. </p>

  <h2>Context-enriched patterns of behavior at home for Ambient Assisted Living</h2>
  <p>(PhD project) In Ambient Assisted Living routine deviations are usually used as a sign that assistance is needed. However, to reduce false alarms, context must be considered to assess when a routine deviation is truly an anomaly or when it is a result of a change in context, i.e. it is raining and the person can&#8217;t go out.  In this project, I proposed context-enriched behavior patterns to describe routines with the context they occur on and a stream learning algorithm to discover them. </p>

  <h2>Automatic Nurse Care Record Recreation with Activity Recognition </h2>
  <p>(Postdoc at Kyutech) By using activity recognition based on sensor data and historical data of nurses activities, we aim at reducing documentation workload by partially filling the nurse&#8217;s record for the day.</p>
